This updated content provides clear instructions and is formatted to be easily understood by anyone setting up the Travel Advisor app. Make sure to replace the placeholder text (`"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`) with the actual API keys and include any necessary images or links where indicated.


To create a `README.md` file for setting up LogRocket in a React application, follow the instructions below. LogRocket helps you understand issues in your application by recording videos of user sessions and tracking Redux actions, state, console logs, and more.

Here's a template README for setting up LogRocket:

---

# LogRocket Setup in a React Application

This guide walks you through the steps required to set up LogRocket in your React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A LogRocket account. [Sign up here](https://logrocket.com).
- A React application.
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

### 1. Install the LogRocket package

First, you need to add LogRocket to your project. Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
npm install --save logrocket
```

or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add logrocket
```

### 2. Initialize LogRocket in Your Application

In your React application, you need to initialize LogRocket at the entry point (typically in `src/index.js` or `src/index.tsx` for TypeScript).

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

// Import and initialize LogRocket
import LogRocket from 'logrocket';
LogRocket.init('your-app-id');

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Replace `'your-app-id'` with the actual App ID from your LogRocket dashboard.

### 3. (Optional) Integrate LogRocket with Redux

If your application uses Redux, you can also integrate LogRocket to track Redux actions and state.

```bash
npm install --save logrocket redux-logrocket
```

Then, configure your Redux store:

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';
import LogRocket from 'logrocket';
import createLogger from 'redux-logger';
import logrocketMiddleware from 'redux-logrocket';

const middleware = [logrocketMiddleware(LogRocket), createLogger()];

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(...middleware)
);
```

### 4. (Optional) Enable Session Replay

LogRocket records videos of user sessions by default. If you want to customize this feature, you can use the `identify` and `captureMessage` methods:

```javascript
LogRocket.identify('user-id', {
  name: 'User Name',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  // Add your custom user properties here
});

LogRocket.captureMessage('A custom log message');
```

### 5. Verify LogRocket is Working

To ensure LogRocket is working correctly:

- Run your React app: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
- Interact with your app, and then check your LogRocket dashboard for the session recordings.

Here's a revised version of the section for your ReadMe file:

---

### 6. Capture Console Logs

If you need to log data without it appearing in the browser console during development, use the following method:

```javascript
LogRocket.log('foo', { bar: 'baz' });
```

You can adjust LogRocket’s console capture behavior by modifying its settings as needed.

Here’s the revised version for your ReadMe file:

---
#### Disable Console Logging

To stop logging console data to LogRocket, set the `isEnabled` flag to `false`.

#### Configuration Example:

```javascript
LogRocket.init(YOUR_APP_ID, {
  console: {
    isEnabled: false, // Disables logging of console data
  },
});
```

By default, `isEnabled` is set to `true`, allowing console data capture. To disable this, update the configuration as shown above.

---

### 7. Include iFrames within the Same Session Recording

By default, LogRocket treats iframes as separate tabs in the video replay. If you want to merge iframes into a single video session, you can configure this by using the `mergeIframes` option.

#### Merging iFrames into the Same Session Recording

To include iframes within the same session recording, set the `mergeIframes` flag to `true`. Ensure this option is added to both your main `init()` call and the iframe's `init()` call.

#### Configuration Example:

```javascript
LogRocket.init(YOUR_APP_ID, {
  mergeIframes: true, // Merges iframes into a single video session
});
```

By default, `mergeIframes` is set to `false`. To merge the iframes into a unified video recording, update the configuration as shown above.

### 8. Tracking Custom Events with LogRocket

If you use an analytics tool, you may already track custom events to measure user behavior. You can make these events accessible in LogRocket by using the `LogRocket.track()` method.

#### Calling `LogRocket.track()`

The `LogRocket.track()` method accepts a single string argument representing the event name:

```javascript
LogRocket.track('visited website');
```

You can search for sessions containing these events using a **Custom Event** filter in the LogRocket Dashboard.

#### Adding Event Properties

Optionally, you can pass a second object argument to provide additional properties related to the event. These properties help you capture more detailed information about the event.

#### Example:

```javascript
LogRocket.track('visited website', {
  website:'https://www.hotelthakar.com/'
});
```

This allows you to log specific event details, making your session recordings and analytics more insightful.

### 9. Manually Reporting Errors with `captureException()`

You can use `LogRocket.captureException()` to manually report errors caught in your code. This is useful for sending detailed error information and additional context to LogRocket for troubleshooting.

#### Calling `captureException()`

```javascript
try {
  doSomethingBroken();
} catch (err) {
  LogRocket.captureException(err, {
    tags: {
      // Additional data to be grouped as "tags"
      subscription: 'Pro',
    },
    extra: {
      // Additional arbitrary data associated with the event
      pageName: 'ProfileView',
    },
  });
}
```

#### Adding Tags and Extra Metadata

You can use `tags` and `extra` to send additional metadata along with the error report:
- **Tags**: Used for grouping data, such as user subscription levels or categories.
- **Extra**: Arbitrary data to provide more context around the error, such as the page or action involved.

Both `tags` and `extra` must contain scalar values (booleans, numbers, or strings). This metadata will appear alongside the error in the **Issues** view on the LogRocket dashboard, under **Custom Tags** and **Additional Data** sections respectively.

Here’s the rewritten version for your ReadMe file:

### 10. Capture Error Messages

You can manually surface error messages in the LogRocket dashboard using the `LogRocket.captureMessage()` method. This allows you to log custom messages, which will be treated as errors in LogRocket for further tracking and investigation.

#### Calling `captureMessage()`

```javascript
LogRocket.captureMessage('Something is wrong!', {
  tags: {
    // Additional data to be grouped as "tags"
    subscription: 'Pro',
  },
  extra: {
    // Additional arbitrary data associated with the event
    pageName: 'ProfileView',
  },
});
```
Here’s the revised version for your ReadMe file:

---

### 11. Log Redux Actions

LogRocket allows you to log Redux actions in your app along with the associated state, making it easier to track state changes during user sessions.

#### Adding Redux Logs to LogRocket

To log Redux actions in LogRocket, you need to add a middleware to your Redux store by calling `LogRocket.reduxMiddleware()`.

#### Basic Installation:

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(
  reducer, // your app reducer
  applyMiddleware(LogRocket.reduxMiddleware())
);
```

#### Using Redux with Other Middlewares

If your app uses multiple middlewares, ensure that `LogRocket.reduxMiddleware()` is the final middleware in the chain:

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(
  reducer, // your app reducer
  applyMiddleware(middlewares, LogRocket.reduxMiddleware())
);
```

By including this middleware, all Redux actions and their associated state will be captured in the LogRocket session recordings.

---

## Troubleshooting

If LogRocket isn't capturing sessions or if you're facing issues, consider:

- Checking the browser's console for any errors related to LogRocket.
- Verifying the App ID used in `LogRocket.init()` matches the one in your LogRocket dashboard.
- Ensuring your network allows traffic to LogRocket domains.
